## Instructions

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.


## Bonus

Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 

Make the appropriate adjustments to my VBA script to allow it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) just by running the VBA script once.

## Other Considerations

* I Used the sheet `alphabetical_testing.xlsx` while developing your code. This data set is smaller and allowed me to test faster. My code should run on this file in less than 3 to 5 minutes.

* I verified that the script acts the same on every sheet. The joy of VBA is that it takes the tediousness out of repetitive tasks with one click of a button.
